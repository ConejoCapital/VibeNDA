# VibeNDA — Non-Disclosure Agreement (Terms)

**Last updated:** January 2026

---

## 1. Definitions

- **"Confidential Information"** means the software, user interfaces, features, designs, code, and any materials displayed or made available to you after you complete the reveal action, including any vibe-coded or unreleased project content (the **"Project"**).
- **"Viewer"** or **"You"** means the person who performs the reveal action and gains access to the Project.
- **"Disclosing Party"** means the developer, project owner, or entity that controls the Project and has integrated the VibeNDA gateway.
- **"Trade Secret"** — The parties acknowledge that the Confidential Information may constitute trade secrets under applicable law (including the Defend Trade Secrets Act and state Uniform Trade Secrets Act). Unauthorized disclosure or use causes significant and difficult-to-quantify harm.

## 2. Consent and Execution of Agreement

**By sliding to reveal (or otherwise completing the designated reveal action), you execute this VibeNDA and bind yourself to these terms.** You affirm that:

- You have read (or had the opportunity to read) these terms via the link provided at the gateway.
- You consent to the collection of technical identifiers (IP address, browser fingerprint, session ID, timezone, device and browser characteristics) and any voluntarily provided contact information, for the purposes of proving your consent and enforcing this agreement.
- You agree that your completion of the reveal action constitutes your electronic signature and affirmative assent under the U.S. E-Sign Act and applicable state electronic transaction laws.

## 3. Obligations

You agree to:

- **Not disclose** any Confidential Information to any third party without prior written consent of the Disclosing Party.
- **Not copy, reproduce, or reverse engineer** the Project or any part of the Confidential Information.
- **Use** the Confidential Information solely for the permitted purpose of viewing or evaluating the Project as authorized by the Disclosing Party.
- **Keep** all Confidential Information strictly confidential for the duration of this agreement and thereafter as set out in the survival section.

---

## 4. Term and Survival

This agreement is effective from the moment you complete the reveal action. Your obligations of non-disclosure and non-use survive for **five (5) years** after your last access to the Confidential Information, or to the maximum extent permitted by law for trade secrets (including perpetual protection where applicable).

---

## 5. Remedies

- **Injunctive relief:** The Disclosing Party is entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent or stop any breach or threatened breach, without the need to prove irreparable harm or to post a bond, to the extent permitted by law.
- **Indemnification:** You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Disclosing Party from any losses, damages, or costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from your breach of this agreement.
- **Liquidated damages (Trade Secret framing):** The parties agree that the Confidential Information has significant commercial value and that actual damages from unauthorized disclosure or use are difficult to ascertain. Accordingly, the parties agree that **liquidated damages** in the amount of **fifty thousand United States dollars (USD $50,000)** per breach, or the actual damages suffered (whichever is greater), represent a reasonable estimate of the harm caused by such breach. This clause is intended as liquidated damages and not as a penalty. In jurisdictions where penalty or liquidated damages clauses are limited or unenforceable, the Disclosing Party retains the right to seek all other available remedies, including actual damages and injunctive relief.

---

## 6. Miscellaneous

- **Governing law:** This agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to conflict of law principles.
- **Entire agreement:** This document, together with the gateway notice and any linked policy, constitutes the entire agreement between you and the Disclosing Party regarding the Confidential Information.
- **Severability:** If any provision is held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in full force and effect.
- **No waiver:** Failure to enforce any provision does not constitute a waiver of that provision or any other.
